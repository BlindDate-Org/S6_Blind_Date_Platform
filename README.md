# SeeThrough

SeeThrough is Q & A Platform with Tinder flavours,
Users can ask questions in selected communities and can answer them through a personalized question feed.<br/>
SeeThrough's main stakeholders are part of a research group at [Fontys](https://fontys.nl/) that focusses on [visually impaired](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_impairment) people so Accessibility has been part of the project from day-one.<br/><br/>
The stakeholders goals are defined as follows:

- Can technology help visually impaired people with asking difficult and intimate questions?
- How do people respond and use this developed app?

Furthermore SeeThrough has been built with scalability in mind meaning an Event driven microservices architecture was the chosen approach.
This architecture has been deployed in a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster.
